## Summary

Using the Javascript and SQL, I have set up a restful API to perform GET, PATCH, POST and DELETE requests to the PostgreSql database.

# Setup

If you would like a local copy of the API, please follow the below instructions:

- Fork it to your GitHub
- Clone the link
- Run the command "git clone (insert clone address here"
- Run npm install
- Run npm setup-dbs

# Versions

For the API to work you will need to install Node (version 14+), npm (version 8+) and PostgresQL (version 13+). Earlier versions have not been tested but may still work.
